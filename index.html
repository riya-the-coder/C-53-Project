       A declarative style(- we tell what are
       the different components we want in the application)
     of coding would make the app more organized.
        For that we have a new programming language called JSX and a new mobile development
        framework called React Native to help build powerful and complex apps in an easy way.
        JSX is a combination of both HTML and Javascript.  JSX and React Native code in an online editor called 'snack'
        'Snack' is an online editor written by Expo,
         which allows us to write and compile React
Native code in an online environment. 
We can also preview the output of the code using
Snack.

        <Text></Text> tag which you see is such a React component.
         This component allows you to write text on the screen.
         Text is a component which is already defined in a library called React Native.
         When compared to HTML tags which start with lowercase letters, React native
         components start with uppercase.
         A Component is a Base class (Parent class) from which all components are inherited from.
         A Component is a baseclass and all React components are inherited from this baseclass Component.
Component class is defined in the React library. 
App itself is a React Native Component.
 All React Native components must live inside the App Component.
Things will become clearer soon when we practically start making an App.
Now you can see that there is only one defined function inside the App Class - it is called
render()
‘render()’ function simply displays whatever components are returned by it.
Here, you can see that the <Text> component is returned. So, the <Text> component gets
rendered or displayed on the screen.
Notice that all the code in the file is Javascript except the code inside render. This is JSX. It
contains tags which correspond to React Components.
We can write Javascript inside JSX using { } 'curly brackets'
You can also see that the Text component has a style 'property' defined on it. Just like html
tags have some properties defined on them
(For example: <img> tag has src, width, height etc.)
"style" property takes a json object {}.
When we are rendering components using JSX tags (<Text>), we can write/execute
Javascript inside the {}.
You see two {{ }} because one {} says that we are going to write javascript code. The other {}
is for the json object.
Also, we write CSS properties in React Native in camel case (marginTop instead of
margin-top)

In this way using this we can write and preview the output in our smartphone using Snack.
